# **Multi-linear-regression**
This project demonstrates a multiple regression analysis using a dataset and Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn. The goal is to predict a continuous output variable (price) based on multiple input features from the provided dataset.


**Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:

pandas

numpy

matplotlib

seaborn

scikit-learn

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

**Dataset**

Replace the file path in the code (r"C:\Users\KIIT\Downloads\Multilr.csv") with the path to your own dataset.


This project provides a basic framework for performing multiple regression analysis using Python. The code includes data loading, preprocessing, model training, prediction, evaluation, and residual analysis steps.

you can modify this model according to your requirement
